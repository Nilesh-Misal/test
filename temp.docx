The goal of this module is to allow users to prepare high quality publications (such as
books, magazines, long reports, etc…). While LaTeX is definitely a top quality engine for
typesetting scientific documents, it has its shortcomings. Most notably is the rigidity of the
language and the inability of the user to draw the layout of the publication pages flexibly.
Publishers (especially for magazines and journals) like to have the flexibility of designing
the pages in anyway they want. We aim to build on the technology used for the HTML
webpage module, and add to it the following features (when the Publication Primary
module is used)
1. It must be built on a good freeBSD word processor. I heard from Shreyansh that
such free libraries for word processing exist. The word processor should support
things like table of contents, index, and bibliography.
2. The ability to select a document class (we will have some default settings and the
customer can make a customized document and save it)
3. Select the pages size (in mm and inch), margins
4. Select the paper quality (type the paper quality in an empty field - for the use of the
printing press); later we will make a list of options once we are in contact with a
printing press.
5. Select the cover type (softcover, Glossy Hardcover, Leatherbound hardcover,
with/without dust jacket etc…); For these we also need to be in contact with a
printing press for books.
6. Select some global settings for the document (default font size,type,color) for the
main body text, and the same for the headers, sections etc… ; one can of course
change manually within the text, but we need some default settings to be defined
with every document.
